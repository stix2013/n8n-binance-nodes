Analyse for **ETHUSDT** at 2026-02-24 22:06
Current Price: **$1919.68**

**📊 MARKET STRUCTURE: Bullish (Medium-Term) / Bearish (Short-Term Correction)**
The market is currently in a **Bullish** trend on medium and long-term timeframes (15m, 1h, 4h), but is undergoing a necessary **Short-term Bearish correction**. Confidence in the overall uptrend remains at **70%**, provided key support levels hold.

**🎯 TRADING RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Action:** **WAIT** (Look for Long entry on exhaustion of the current dip)
- **Entry Zone:** **$1905 - $1912** (Alignment with 15m EMA 12 and psychological support)
- **Stop Loss:** **$1884** (Just below the 15m EMA 26)
- **Target 1 (2:1 R:R):** **$1933** (Recent local high and 4h EMA 50 resistance)
- **Target 2 (3:1 R:R):** **$1955** (Next major structural resistance)

**📈 SIGNAL BREAKDOWN:**
- **Confluence Score:** **Moderate**
- **Key Bullish Factors:**
    - Strong MACD bullish crossovers on 15m, 1h, and 4h timeframes.
    - Price remains structurally above the 15m and 1h EMA ribbons.
    - 4h MACD has recently crossed bullishly, indicating a potential long-term trend shift.
- **Key Bearish Factors:**
    - **Overbought Conditions:** 15m RSI (71.3) and 1h RSI (72.9) are in overbought territory, necessitating a pullback.
    - **Short-term Momentum:** 1m MACD and EMA are both bearish, with price making lower highs over the last 45 minutes.
    - **Major Resistance:** Price rejected sharply at the 4h EMA 50 ($1933.98).
- **Primary Risk:** The current correction could turn into a deeper reversal if the $1900 psychological level is lost with high volume.

**⚠️ RISK WARNING:**
Do **NOT** enter a Long position while the 1m MACD histogram is still declining. Wait for the 1m RSI to touch the 30-35 range or for a bullish MACD crossover on the 1m/5m timeframe to confirm the end of the correction.

**💡 CONTEXT NOTES:**
ETH is currently testing the strength of its recent breakout. The rejection at the 4h EMA 50 is a classic technical hurdle. Successful consolidation above $1900 would be a highly bullish signal for a move toward $2000. Monitor volume during the pullback; decreasing volume on the dip suggests a healthy retracement rather than a trend reversal.
