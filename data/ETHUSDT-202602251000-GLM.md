## TRADE DECISION

**Action: WAIT**

**Rationale:**
- RSI on 15m (71.3) and 1h (72.9) approaching mean reversion territory (>75)
- 1m timeframe showing bearish momentum conflicts with higher timeframe bullishness
- Price trading below 4h EMA 200 (2235.48) - macro trend remains bearish
- Insufficient confirming factors for directional trade

**Entry Zone:** Wait for trigger

**Conditions to Monitor:**
- **For SHORT:** Wait for RSI >75 on 15m/1h + 1m MACD bearish crossover confirmation
- **For LONG:** Wait for RSI pullback to 50-60 zone + 1m EMA bullish crossover

**Stop Loss:** N/A

**Target 1:** N/A

**Target 2:** N/A

⚠️ **Risk Note:** High overbought conditions on medium timeframes suggest elevated reversal probability. Wait for clear confirmation before entry.
