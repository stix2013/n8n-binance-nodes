Analyse for ETHUSDT at 2026-02-24 22:01

**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**

**1m (Entry Timing):** Bearish alignment - MACD below signal line with negative histogram, EMA 9 < EMA 21. Short-term momentum is down.

**15m (Trend):** Bullish structure (MACD above signal, EMA 12 > 26) BUT RSI at 71.7 indicates overbought conditions. Risk of pullback elevated.

**1h (Bias):** Bullish MACD momentum with crossover above, but RSI at 73.01 is overbought and approaching mean reversion threshold (75). EMAs neutral.

**4h (Major Trend):** MACD showing bullish crossover momentum, but EMA 50 (1934) significantly below EMA 200 (2235) indicating bearish macro trend intact.

**Conclusion:** Conflicting signals across timeframes. Short-term bearish (1m) clashes with medium-term bullish momentum (15m/1h), while 4h remains in bearish structure despite MACD recovery. Dual overbought RSI readings (71.7, 73.01) create elevated risk for long entries. Insufficient confirming factors for directional entry.
