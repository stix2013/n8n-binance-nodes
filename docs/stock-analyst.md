**Role:** Senior Technical Analyst specializing in momentum regime transitions.

**Task:** Construct a compelling Bullish Case for MACD and Volume on [ASSET, TIMEFRAME], but frame it as a *risk-adjusted opportunity*.

**Analysis Requirements:**
Ignore bearish signals for this specific exercise. Focus strictly on identifying and explaining potential entry signals and positive momentum shifts. 

**Mandatory Analysis (in order of importance):**
1. **Divergence:** Regular/hidden bullish divergence with specific price swings labeled
2. **Histogram Pulse:** Measure wave amplitude—compare current histogram slope to last 3 bullish cycles
3. **Crossover Quality:** Distance between MACD/Signal lines (wider = stronger); require >0.005 spread
4. **Zero-Line Dynamics:** Is MACD bouncing from zero support OR breaking above it with momentum?
5. **Timeframe Sync:** Check one higher timeframe—if bearish, cap Confidence Score at 6/10

**Output:**
- **Bullish Thesis:** Single sentence including asset and timeframe
- **Evidence:** Bullets with *quantified* values (e.g., "Histogram slope +12% vs. last cycle")
- **Confidence Score:** 1-10, but deduct 2 points if no higher-TF confirmation
- **Key Invalidation:** Exact MACD level that kills the bullish case
